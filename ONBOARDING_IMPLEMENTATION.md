# Onboarding Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document describes the guided onboarding flow implementation for helping users create their first log and use the analyzer feature. The implementation is dramatic, funny, and fully aligned with the app's personality while maintaining a seamless guest user experience.

## üé≠ Features Implemented

### 1. **Onboarding State Management** ([src/lib/onboarding.ts](src/lib/onboarding.ts))
- Tracks user progress through key features:
  - `has_created_first_log` - Whether user has created their first journal entry
  - `has_used_analyzer` - Whether user has used the analyzer feature
- Stores data in localStorage for persistence across sessions
- Provides migration safety for existing users without onboarding data
- Syncs with API for authenticated users

### 2. **API Integration** ([src/lib/api.ts](src/lib/api.ts))
New API endpoints integrated:
- `GET /api/me/feature-status` - Fetches user's onboarding status
- `POST /api/analyzer/mark-used` - Marks analyzer as used

### 3. **Type Definitions** ([src/types/user.ts](src/types/user.ts))
Updated user types to include:
- `has_created_first_log: boolean`
- `first_log_created_at: string | null`
- `has_used_analyzer: boolean`
- `first_analyzer_used_at: string | null`

### 4. **Onboarding Components**

#### OnboardingBanner ([src/components/OnboardingBanner.tsx](src/components/OnboardingBanner.tsx))
- Inline banner displayed on the dashboard
- Two variants:
  - **First Log Banner**: "Your First Log Awaits, Brave Soul!"
    - Yellow theme with scroll icon
    - Dramatic copy about the blank page trembling
  - **Analyzer Banner**: "The Analyzer Hungers for Your Data..."
    - Purple theme with magic wand icon
    - Humorous copy about fortune cookies and buffering crystal balls
- Dismissible with smooth animations
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop

#### OnboardingCue ([src/components/OnboardingCue.tsx](src/components/OnboardingCue.tsx))
- Fixed position floating cue (bottom-right corner)
- Same two variants as banner
- Decorative corner elements for visual flair
- Smooth exit animation when dismissed

### 5. **Integration Points**

#### Dashboard ([src/app/dashboard/page.tsx](src/app/dashboard/page.tsx))
- Loads onboarding status on mount
- Displays appropriate banner based on user progress
- Syncs with API for authenticated users
- Falls back to localStorage if API fails
- Tracks banner dismissals with Mixpanel

#### Journal Page ([src/app/journal/JournalClient.tsx](src/app/journal/JournalClient.tsx))
- Detects when user creates their first log entry
- Marks `has_created_first_log` in localStorage
- Shows celebratory toast: "üéâ Your first log is complete! The journey has begun!"
- Tracks event with `isFirstLog` flag for analytics

#### Analyzer Page ([src/app/analyzer/page.tsx](src/app/analyzer/page.tsx))
- Detects when user generates their first prompt
- Marks `has_used_analyzer` in localStorage
- Calls API endpoint to sync with backend (authenticated users only)
- Shows celebratory toast: "‚ú® You've unlocked the power of the analyzer!"
- Tracks event with `isFirstUse` flag for analytics

### 6. **Guest User Support**

The implementation fully supports guest users:

1. **Storage**: Onboarding status stored in localStorage with key `onboardingStatus`
2. **Cleanup**: Onboarding data cleared when:
   - User logs out ([src/lib/api.ts](src/lib/api.ts))
   - Guest data is cleared ([src/lib/guest.ts](src/lib/guest.ts))
3. **Migration**: When guest users sign up, their onboarding status is preserved
4. **Fallback**: If API fails, falls back to localStorage gracefully

### 7. **Styling & Animations** ([src/app/globals.css](src/app/globals.css))

Added custom animations:
```css
.animate-bounce-slow {
  animation: bounceSlow 2s ease-in-out infinite;
}
```

## üé® Design Philosophy

### Tone & Personality
- **Dramatic**: "Every legend starts with a single entry. Your destiny awaits..."
- **Funny**: "Our own crystal ball is, uh... buffering. Let's just say our LLM budget went into buying this cool font."
- **Motivating**: Quest unlocked badges, power-up notifications
- **Self-aware**: References to buffering, budget constraints, and the mystical nature of the analyzer

### Visual Design
- Gradient backgrounds (yellow for first log, purple for analyzer)
- Themed icons (scroll, magic wand, stars)
- Special toast notifications with custom styling
- Decorative elements (sparkles, corner accents)
- Smooth animations for show/hide

## üìä Analytics Integration

All onboarding events are tracked with Mixpanel:
- `Dashboard Viewed` - Includes onboarding status
- `Entry Created` - Includes `isFirstLog` flag
- `Prompt Generated` - Includes `isFirstUse` flag
- `Onboarding Banner Dismissed` - Tracks which banner was dismissed

## üîÑ Data Flow

### For Authenticated Users:
1. User visits dashboard
2. System fetches onboarding status from API
3. Status synced to localStorage
4. Banner displayed if applicable
5. User completes action (creates log/uses analyzer)
6. Status updated in both localStorage and API
7. Banner automatically hidden on next visit

### For Guest Users:
1. User visits dashboard
2. System reads onboarding status from localStorage
3. Banner displayed if applicable
4. User completes action
5. Status updated in localStorage only
6. Banner automatically hidden on next visit

## üöÄ Migration Strategy

### Existing Users
The implementation handles existing users gracefully:
1. If `onboardingStatus` doesn't exist in localStorage, returns default (not completed)
2. API returns actual status from backend for authenticated users
3. This may show banners to existing users, which is intentional to introduce new features
4. Users can dismiss banners permanently

### New Users
- Start with clean slate
- See first log banner immediately
- See analyzer banner after creating first log

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Guest user creates first log ‚Üí sees celebration toast
- [ ] Guest user sees analyzer banner after first log
- [ ] Guest user uses analyzer ‚Üí sees celebration toast
- [ ] Guest user dismisses banner ‚Üí banner doesn't reappear
- [ ] Authenticated user onboarding status syncs with API
- [ ] Logout clears onboarding data
- [ ] Exit guest mode clears onboarding data
- [ ] Banners display correctly on mobile/desktop
- [ ] Animations are smooth and performant
- [ ] Mixpanel events tracked correctly

## üîß Configuration

### localStorage Keys:
- `onboardingStatus` - Stores user's onboarding progress
- Automatically cleared on logout/guest mode exit

### API Endpoints:
- `GET /api/me/feature-status` - Get onboarding status
- `POST /api/analyzer/mark-used` - Mark analyzer as used
- Backend automatically marks first log creation

## üìù Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add more onboarding steps for advanced features
2. Create a "tour" mode for new users
3. Add achievement system for milestones
4. Personalized onboarding based on user goals
5. Progressive disclosure of advanced features

## üéâ Conclusion

This implementation provides a fun, engaging onboarding experience that:
- Guides users naturally through key features
- Maintains the app's dramatic and humorous personality
- Works seamlessly for both guest and authenticated users
- Tracks important metrics for product insights
- Respects user choice (dismissible banners)
- Handles edge cases and migrations gracefully

The journey has begun! üöÄ‚ú®
